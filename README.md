# timely

Quick command line tool helper to quickly generate meeting times across specified timezones.

## Disclaimer
This was just a fun evening project that isn't going to be maintained/improved (unless the mood strikes me), nor was it written to be 'production-ready' in any sense.


## Installation

`npm install`

## Usage

```
npm run build
cd lib
node ./index.js -t <hour of time to convert>
```

Example of the last command: `node ./index.js -t 12`
